<MarkdownLayout headline="Capturing nickel-hydroxide battery <strong>&nbspusing mathematics&nbsp</strong>.">
In one of my two undergrad senior year reseach projects, I present a mean-field model of the nickel-hydroxide (Ni(OH)2) electrode in the Edison rechargeable battery. The model aims to describe the electrode's dynamics, charge transport, and phase separation. The Poisson-Nernst-Planck equation is used to describe the charge transport, while the Cahn-Hilliard approach is used to model the phase separation. Then, the model equations are solved numerically. Before I'll present the project, let's see an importent permilmeniry work I did.

# Numerically solving the PNP equations
While my advisor and I were working on the mathematical model, I also tried to tackle my first numerical problem - solving the Poission Nernst Planck equations. I provided quite a detailed solution, which I will present here.


We would like to solve the following equations (in 1D):
$$
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} &= \nabla^2 p + \nabla(p\nabla \phi) \\
    \frac{\partial n}{\partial t} &= \nabla^2 n - \nabla(n\nabla \phi) \\
    \nabla^2 \phi &= n - p
\end{align}
$$
Subject to the boundary conditions:
$$
\begin{align}
    \nabla p + p \nabla \phi &= \nabla n - n \nabla \phi = 0, \, x=L,0 \\
    \phi(L_x) &= 1, \phi(0) = -1
\end{align}
$$
To find $\phi$ for all $x$ at the current step, I will use the implicit finite difference method.
After applying finite difference, the potential $\phi(x,t)$ at the point $x_m, 0<m<M-1$ would be:
$$
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\Delta x^2}{2}(p_m - n_m) = \phi_m -\frac{1}{2} \phi_{m+1} -\frac{1}{2} \phi_{m-1}
\end{equation}
$$
Therefore, solving for $\phi$ at a certain time would mean solving the following matrix:
$$
\begin{equation}
       \begin{bmatrix}
          1 & -\frac{1}{2} & 0 & 0 & ... \\
          -\frac{1}{2} & 1 & -\frac{1}{2} & 0 & ... \\
          ... & ... \\
          ... & 0 & -\frac{1}{2} & 1 & -\frac{1}{2} \\
          ... & 0 & 0 & -\frac{1}{2} & 1
       \end{bmatrix}
       \begin{bmatrix}
          \phi_1 \\
          \phi_2 \\
          ... \\
          \phi_{M-3} \\
          \phi_{M-2}
       \end{bmatrix}    
         =
         \frac{\Delta x^2}{2}
          \begin{bmatrix}
           p_1 - n_1 + \frac{1}{\Delta x^2} \phi_0 \\
           p_2 - n_2 \\
           ... \\
           p_{M-3} - n_{M-3} \\
           p_{M-2} - n_{M-2} + \frac{1}{\Delta x^2} \phi_M
        
           \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
$$
Notice that the LHS matrix is composed of $(M-2)$ ones, and $(M-3)$ elements $-\frac{1}{2}$ on each diagonal.  

In python, it looks like this:
```python
def get_phi(phi_0, phi_M, n, p, dx, n_l=0, n_r=0):
    # TODO: add phi_neumann conditions

    # Creating the coeff matrix
    coeff_matrix = np.diag(np.ones(M-2)) + np.diag(-0.5*np.ones(M-3), 1) + np.diag(-0.5*np.ones(M-3), -1)

    # Creating the RHS result vector
    result_vector = np.array([p[m]-n[m] for m in range(2, M-2)])
    right_res = p[M-2] - n[M-2] + phi_M/(dx**2)
    left_res = p[1] - n[1] + phi_0/(dx**2)
    result_vector = ((dx**2)/2)*np.append(np.insert(result_vector, 0, left_res), right_res)

    # Solving for phi and adding the boundry
    phi_trimmed = np.linalg.solve(coeff_matrix, result_vector)
    phi = np.append(np.insert(phi_trimmed, 0, phi_0), phi_M)

    return phi
```

Together with finding $\phi$, we need to iterate $p(x,t), n(x,t)$. It means finding $p_m^{i+1}, n_m^{i+1}$. We assume that we have $p_m^j, n_m^j$ for every $m, j<i$.
I will use explicit central difference method to get:
$$
\begin{align}
    \begin{split}
        p_m^{i+1} = {}& p_m^{i} + \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2} [ p_{m+1}^i + p_{m-1}^i - 2p_m^i + \frac{1}{4}(p_{m+1}^i-p_{m-1}^i)(\phi_{m+1}^i-\phi_{m-1}^i) \\
        & + p_m^i(\phi_{m+1}^i+\phi_{m-1}^i-2\phi_m^i) ]
    \end{split} \\
    \begin{split}
        n_m^{i+1} = {}& n_m^{i} + \frac{ \Delta t}{\Delta x^2} [ n_{m+1}^i + n_{m-1}^i - 2n_m^i - \frac{1}{4}(n_{m+1}^i-n_{m-1}^i)(\phi_{m+1}^i-\phi_{m-1}^i) \\
        & - n_m^i(\phi_{m+1}^i+\phi_{m-1}^i-2\phi_m^i) ]
    \end{split}
\end {align}
$$
This can be implemented nicely using NumPy:
```python
def iterate_concentration(c, phi, dx, dt, positive, flux_l=0, flux_r=0, neumann=False):
    """
    Assume c and phi are 1XM vectors 
    c_pp - c-prime-prime, cp - c-prime, phi_pp - phi-prime-prime, phi_p - phi-prime
    
    """
    sign = 1 if positive else -1

    c_1, c_M = c[0], c[M-1]
    phi_1, phi_M = phi[0], phi[M-1]
    # c_prev_1, c_prev_M = c_prev[0], c_prev[M-1]


    c_rolled = np.roll(c, 1)
    c_rolled_back = np.roll(c, -1)
    np.put(c_rolled, [0, -1], [c_1, c_M]) # Creating c_{m+1}
    np.put(c_rolled_back, [0, -1], [c_1, c_M]) # Creating c_{m-1}

    phi_rolled = np.roll(phi, 1)
    phi_rolled_back = np.roll(phi, -1)
    np.put(phi_rolled, [0, -1], [phi_1, phi_M]) # Creating phi_{m+1}
    np.put(phi_rolled_back, [0, -1], [phi_1, phi_M]) # Creating phi_{m+1}

    c_pp = c_rolled + c_rolled_back - 2*c
    c_p = c_rolled - c_rolled_back
    
    phi_pp = phi_rolled + phi_rolled_back - 2*phi
    phi_p = phi_rolled - phi_rolled_back
    # print(phi_p, phi_pp)

    c_iter = c + dt/(dx**2)*(c_pp + (1/4)*sign*c_p*phi_p + sign*c*phi_pp)
    
    if neumann:
        c_iter[0] = (dx*flux_l - c_iter[1])/(sign*(phi[1]-phi[0])-1)
        c_iter[-1] = c_iter[-2] - sign*c_iter[-2]*(phi[-1]-phi[-2]) + dx*flux_r


    return c_iter
```
This eventually, results in this beautiful animation

# The actual nickel-hydroxide project

We started from a different set of mathematical equations, but quickly realized that we have to modify the mathematical model to our specific setup. Eventually, the model equations took the following form:

$$
\begin{align}
    0 ={}& -n + \partial_x (\epsilon \partial_x \phi)\\
    \frac{\partial n}{\partial t} ={}& D_n \partial_x \cdot (\partial_x n - n \partial_x \phi) - \frac{\alpha}{2} \big( (1-u)n - (1+u)(1-n) \big)\\
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} ={}& D_u \partial_x \cdot (1-u^2) \left[ \frac{1}{1-u^2} \partial_x u + \beta W''(u) \partial_x u + \lambda \partial_x \psi \right] \\
    & + \frac{\alpha}{2} \big( (1-u)n - (1+u)(1-n) \big) \\
    \psi ={}& \partial_x ^2 u
\end{align}
$$

Essentialy, the equations describe the motion of the ions inside the solution, affected by diffusion, electric forces, and concentration gradients. 
A full description of the model, its parameters, and the code, can be found <a class="textlink" href="https://github.com/nadav7679/phase_field_Ni_batteries/blob/main/Mean_field_of_nickel_hydroxide_electrode_in_Edison_rechargeable_battery_final.pdf">in my GitHub</a>.  

An essential part of the dynamcis is the phase-transition the material goes through (this was modeled with Cahn-Hilliard equations). We can see this dynamics in action in the following figure:
<img class="w-10/12" src="/projects_media/nickel-hydroxide/nickel.jpg"/>

The figure was created in MatLab and it shows a Space-time plot with an input electron flux (to the electrode) from the right. The different phases are Purple - ${Ni(OH)_2}$, Blue - ${NiOOH}$. Over time, the ${Ni(OH)_2}$ phase takes over the material and the interface moves to the left edge.

After I had to submit the project and continue with my studies, my advisor informed me that he and his fellows developed upon my work a 2D model, that gave them the exact behaviour they looked for (which I will not detail here). Hopefully I will be able to help their efforts and advance their research, so we could publish permilmeniry results in the upcoming couple of yars.
